	<h3>A Little Description About Languages Taught</h3>
	<p style="text-align:justify;"><b>Python</b><br> Python is a general purpose, high level language that emphasizes on code readability. This language supports many different programming paradigms (structured, object oriented, functional, etc.). It was developed back in the 1980’s and is now one of the much needed programming tools in the IT industries and one of the primary focus of our computer training institution.</br>
<b>Java</b><br> It is a high level, object oriented programming language which is designed in a way to have fewer implementation dependencies as possible. Like python, it is also general purpose language, that is intended to run anywhere if written once. Java first appeared in 1995, designed by James Gosling. It is now one of the most popular and widely used programming language.</br>
<b>C</b><br> C is a programming language developed in 70’s by Daniel Ritchie. The design of this language’s features clearly reflects the potentials of a targeted CPU. It is an imperative programming language, which supports structured programming, recursion and lexical scope variable, with a static type system. It was designed for compilation in such a way, that it provides low level access of memory. It is still a widely used language in the programming world. Our computer instructors have a long teaching history with C and are some of the best in Kolkata.</br>
<b>C++</b><br> It is a high level language. It was started as an extension of C programming language, now it has object oriented, generic and functional features, with low level memory manipulation capabilities. It was released first back in 1985, by Bjarne Stroustrup. Its strengths include software infrastructure, resource constrained applications and performance- critical applications. In 2022, it surpassed Java for the first time in the history of the TIOBE (The Importance of Being Earnest) programming community index.</br>
<b>Data Structure</b><br> It is a way of organising, managing and storing data in an efficient manner that will help us access it. It serves as the basis for abstract data types, which defines the logical forms of the data types. Data structures provide a way to efficiently manage large amounts of data for uses such as large databases and Internet indexing services. Often, efficient data structures are essential to making efficient algorithms. Some formal design methods and programming languages emphasize data structures, rather than algorithms, as a major organizing element in software design. Data structures can be used to organize storage and retrieve information stored in both main and secondary memory. It is one of the most common requirements in all coding professions and our main focus in our technical interview training.</br>
<b>PHP</b><br> PHP is a general purpose scripting language mainly used regarding we development. Previously, PHP used to stand for Personal Homepage, but now its abbreviation is changed to Hypertext Pre-processor. It was designed by Rasmus Lerdorf, and was released in 1995. PHP code is typically processed on a web server using a PHP interpreter implemented as a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) module, daemon, or executable. PHP can be utilized for many programming tasks outside of the web context, such as standalone GUI applications and robotic drone control.</br>
<b>JQuery</b><br> JQuery is a JavaScript framework designed to simplify traversing and manipulating the HTML DOM (Document Object Model) tree, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax. This is free and open source software using an MIT license. It was released back in 2006 and as of August 2022, almost 80% of the top 10 million websites use jQuery. Website analysis shows that it is the most widely deployed JavaScript library by a wide margin, having at least 3-4 times more usage than any other JavaScript library. JQuery also gives us a model for event handling that goes beyond basic DOM element selection and manipulation. Event assignment and event call back function definition are also made easier by doing it in one step at one place in the code. JQuery also aims to incorporate other widely used JavaScript features.</br>
<b>JDBC</b><br> The JDBC or Java Database Connectivity is an application programming interface (API) for Java programming language that defines how clients can access databases. It is a Java-based data access technology used to connect Java programs with databases. It is part of the Java Standard Edition platform, from Oracle Corporation. It provides methods for querying and updating data from databases and is geared towards relational databases. The JDBC-to-ODBC Bridge allows connection to any data source accessible by the ODBC in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) host environment.</br>
<b>MySQL</b><br> It is an open source RDBMS or relational database management system. Here SQL stands for Structured Query Language. MySQL works with an operating system to apply a relational database in a storage system of a computer, manage users, enable network access, and facilitate database integrity checks and make a backup. MySQL has standalone clients that allow users to interact directly with MySQL databases using SQL, but MySQL is often used with other programs to deploy applications that require relational database capabilities. MySQL is written in C and C++. Its SQL parser is written in yacc, but it uses a homemade lexical analyser. MySQL runs on multiple system platforms including AIX, BSDi, FreeBSD, HP-UX, ArcaOS, eComStation, IBM, IRIX, Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, NetBSD, Novell NetWare, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris, OS/2 Warp, QNX, Oracle Solaris, Symbian, SunOS, SCO OpenServer, SCO UnixWare, Sanos and Tru64.A port from MySQL to OpenVMS also exists. It is one of the industries’ most sought after DBMS, and our computer teacher’s forte.</br>
<b>PL/SQL</b><br> PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language for SQL. It is the procedural extension for SQL and relational DB for Oracle Corporation. PL/SQL includes procedural language elements such as conditionals and loops, and can handle exceptions (runtime errors). It allows declaring constants and variables, procedures, functions, packages, types and variables of these types and triggers. Supported arrays involve the use of PL/SQL collections. Implementations from version 8 of Oracle Database already include object-oriented related features. One can create PL/SQL units such as procedures, functions, packages, types and triggers, which are stored in the database for reuse by applications using any Oracle programming interface database.</br>
